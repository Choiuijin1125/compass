## What is Compass?
Compass is a Memory Control system powered by the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api). It integrates various advanced features to manage, retrieve, and optimize memories efficiently.

## Main Features

| **Feature**         | **Description**                                                                                     |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Memories**        | **Core Memories**: Central, pivotal memories that are prioritized for quick and efficient access. These are the most important memories that the system retains for immediate retrieval. |
|                     | **Recall Memories**: Provides the ability to bring past memories into focus, leveraging context or specific queries to retrieve relevant information. This ensures that important memories are always accessible when needed. |
| **Gemini API**      | **Query Optimization**: Enhances the efficiency of searches and queries within the memory system, reducing latency and improving the overall performance of memory retrieval operations. |
|                     | **Memory Retrieval**: Ensures fast and accurate retrieval of memories by using advanced algorithms designed to find the most relevant information based on the query or context provided. |
|                     | **Reasoning**: Adds a layer of context-aware processing that helps in decision-making and memory association. This feature enables the system to understand and process complex scenarios, improving the relevance of the memories retrieved. |
|                     | **Save Memories**: |
|                     | **Vector Embedding**: Utilizes vector embeddings to represent memories and other data points in a high-dimensional space, allowing for efficient and accurate similarity searches and comparisons. This feature is crucial for advanced memory retrieval based on contextual or semantic similarities. |
|                     | **Image, Video, Audio Captioning**: Provides the ability to generate captions for multimedia content (images, videos, audio), facilitating easier memory storage and retrieval by associating descriptive text with complex media files. |
| **Firebase**        | **Authentication**: Manages user authentication securely, including user sign-up, login, and session maintenance. Ensures that only authorized users can access the memory management system. |
|                     | **Firestore Database**: Handles the storage of memories, supports vector-based searches, and maintains chat history. Firestore is the backbone for storing and organizing the vast amounts of data related to memories, ensuring they are easily accessible and well-structured. |
|                     | **Storage**: Used for storing larger memory data, such as multimedia files (images, videos, audio), ensuring that these files are securely saved and can be retrieved efficiently when needed. |
| **Next.js**         | **Web Interface**: Powers the web-based user interface for Compass, providing a fast, responsive, and scalable platform for interacting with the memory management system. Next.js ensures that the user experience is seamless and optimized for various devices and network conditions. |
| **Python**          | **Middleware**: Acts as the middleware that connects different components of the system, facilitating communication between the front-end, back-end, and various APIs. Python's flexibility and robust libraries make it ideal for handling complex data processing and integration tasks within Compass. |
