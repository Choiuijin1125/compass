## What is Compass?
Compass is a Memory Control system powered by the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api). It integrates advanced features to manage, retrieve, and optimize memories efficiently.

## Main Features

| **Feature**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Memories**          | **Core Memories**: Critical information that must be referenced in every conversation. This includes the system prompt, user profile, key procedures, and other essential data that guide interactions and decision-making within the system. <br/> **Recall Memories**: Retrieves past memories based on context or specific queries, ensuring relevant information is always accessible when needed.        |
| **Gemini API**        | **Query Optimization**: Enhances search efficiency and reduces latency in memory retrieval operations. <br/> **Memory Retrieval**: Uses advanced algorithms for fast and accurate memory retrieval. <br/> **Reasoning**: Adds context-aware processing for decision-making and memory association. <br/> **Save Memories**: Summarizes and stores conversations using predefined templates. <br/> **Vector Embedding**: Represents memories and data points in a high-dimensional space for efficient similarity searches. <br/> **Image, Video, Audio Captioning**: Generates descriptive captions for multimedia content. |
| **Firebase**          | **Authentication**: Manages secure user authentication. <br/> **Firestore Database**: Stores memories, supports vector-based searches, and maintains chat history. <br/> **Storage**: Stores larger memory data, such as multimedia files, ensuring secure and efficient retrieval. |
| **Next.js**           | **Web Interface**: Powers the web-based user interface, providing a fast, responsive, and scalable platform for interacting with the memory system.                          |
| **Python**            | **Middleware**: Connects different components of the system, facilitating communication between the front-end, back-end, and various APIs. Handles complex data processing and integration tasks. |
