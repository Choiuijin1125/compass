## Core Memories

### What Are Core Memories?
Core Memories in Compass are the essential pieces of information that must be referenced in every interaction between the system and the user. These memories form the foundation of the AI's understanding and interaction framework, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and relevance in responses.

### Components of Core Memories
Core Memories typically include:

**System Prompt**: This is the guiding framework that sets the tone and context for all interactions. It might include instructions on how the AI should behave (e.g., "You are a strict and educational teacher.") and the overall goal of the conversation.
  
**User Profile**: Detailed information about the user, such as their name, age, occupation, interests, skills, goals, and personality traits. This information is crucial for personalizing the interaction and making the AI's responses more relevant and tailored to the user.

**Procedures**: Specific processes or workflows that the system must follow during interactions. This might include how to handle specific types of queries, steps for providing support, or rules for managing user data.

**Critical Context**: Any additional essential data that the system needs to reference to ensure accurate and contextually appropriate responses. This could include past decisions, specific user preferences, or ongoing tasks that the user is engaged with.

### Importance of Core Memories
Core Memories are pivotal because they:

**Ensure Consistency**: By always referencing Core Memories, the AI maintains a consistent approach across interactions, reducing the likelihood of errors or misunderstandings.
  
**Personalize Interactions**: Leveraging detailed user information, the AI can provide responses that are not only accurate but also aligned with the userâ€™s preferences, goals, and personality.

**Guide Decision-Making**: The procedures and critical context within Core Memories help the AI make informed decisions, improving the relevance and quality of its support.

## Recall Memories

### What Are Recall Memories?
Recall Memories are specific past interactions or pieces of information that the system can retrieve based on the context of the current conversation. These memories are not referenced automatically like Core Memories but are brought into focus when they are relevant to the user's query or the ongoing interaction.

### How Recall Memories Work
Recall Memories are dynamically accessed based on triggers or specific queries from the user. For example:

**Contextual Triggers**: If the user mentions a previous conversation or a specific topic, the system will automatically retrieve the relevant Recall Memory to provide continuity and context.
  
**Specific Queries**: If the user asks about something discussed in a past interaction, the system will search for and retrieve the relevant Recall Memory to answer the query accurately.

### Components of Recall Memories
Recall Memories might include:

**Past Conversations**: Previous dialogues that are relevant to the current interaction. For example, if a user previously discussed learning a new programming language, that memory could be recalled when the user asks about related topics.

**Contextual Information**: Details or decisions from past interactions that could influence the current conversation. For example, remembering the user's preferred communication style or past issues they faced.

**Related Concepts**: Information related to the user's current query, even if not directly discussed before. For instance, if the user asks about "relative pronouns," the system might recall a memory where the user struggled with similar grammatical concepts.

### Importance of Recall Memories
Recall Memories are crucial because they:

**Enhance Relevance**: By recalling past interactions, the AI can provide responses that are more relevant and contextually appropriate, improving the user experience.

**Improve Continuity**: Recall Memories help maintain a continuous and coherent conversation flow, ensuring that the AI doesn't repeat information unnecessarily and can build on past discussions.

**Support Personalization**: By remembering specific details from past interactions, the AI can further personalize its responses, making the interaction feel more natural and tailored to the user's needs.

## Summary
In Compass, **Core Memories** are the foundational elements that the AI references in every interaction to maintain consistency, personalization, and effective decision-making. **Recall Memories**, on the other hand, are dynamically accessed memories that bring relevant past interactions into the current conversation, ensuring continuity and enhancing the relevance of the AI's responses.

Understanding and effectively utilizing these two types of memories allows Compass to provide a more intelligent, personalized, and contextually aware interaction experience.
